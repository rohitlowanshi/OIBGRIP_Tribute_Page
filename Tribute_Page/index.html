                    <strong>Also Known As:-</strong> Narendra Damodardas Modi

                <li><strong>Born:-</strong> September 17, 1950 (age 72) India</li>

                <li> <strong> Title / Office:-</strong>prime minister (2014-), India</li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Political Affiliation:-</strong>
                    Bharatiya Janata Party • Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Early life and political career:-</strong>Modi was raised in a small town in northern
                    Gujarat, and he completed an M.A. degree in political science from Gujarat University in Ahmadabad.
                    He joined the pro-Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organization in the early 1970s and set up
                    a unit of the RSS’s students’ wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in his area. Modi rose
                    steadily in the RSS hierarchy, and his association with the organization significantly benefited his
                    subsequent political career.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modi joined the BJP in 1987, and a year later he was made the general secretary of the Gujarat
                    branch of the party. He was instrumental in greatly strengthening the party’s presence in the state
                    in succeeding years. In 1990 Modi was one of the BJP members who participated in a coalition
                    government in the state, and he helped the BJP achieve success in the 1995 state legislative
                    assembly elections that in March allowed the party to form the first-ever BJP-controlled government
                    in India. The BJP’s control of the state government was relatively short-lived, however, ending in
                    September 1996.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Political ascent and term as chief minister of Gujarat:-</strong>In 1995 Modi was made the
                    secretary of the BJP’s national organization in New Delhi, and three years later he was appointed
                    its general secretary. He remained in that office for another three years, but in October 2001 he
                    replaced the incumbent Gujarat chief minister, fellow BJP member Keshubhai Patel, after Patel had
                    been held responsible for the state government’s poor response in the aftermath of the massive Bhuj
                    earthquake in Gujarat earlier that year that killed more than 20,000 people. Modi entered his
                    first-ever electoral contest in a February 2002 by-election that won him a seat in the Gujarat state
                    assembly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modi’s political career thereafter remained a mixture of deep controversy and self-promoted
                    achievements. His role as chief minister during communal riots that engulfed Gujarat in 2002 was
                    particularly questioned. He was accused of condoning the violence or, at least, of doing little to
                    stop the killing of more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, that ensued after dozens of Hindu
                    passengers died when their train was set on fire in the city of Godhra. In 2005 the United States
                    declined to issue him a diplomatic visa on the grounds that he was responsible for the 2002 riots,
                    and the United Kingdom also criticized his role in 2002. Although in the succeeding years Modi
                    himself escaped any indictment or censure—either by the judiciary or by investigative agencies—some
                    of his close associates were found guilty of complicity in the 2002 events and received lengthy jail
                    sentences. Modi’s administration was also accused of involvement in extrajudicial killings
                    (variously termed “encounters” or “fake encounters”) by police or other authorities. One such case,
                    in 2004, involved the deaths of a woman and three men whom officials said were members of
                    Lashkar-e-Taiba (a Pakistan-based terrorist organization that was involved in the 2008 Mumbai
                    terrorist attacks) and were alleged to have been plotting to assassinate Modi.

                    <br>

                    Modi’s repeated political success in Gujarat, however, made him an indispensable leader within the
                    BJP hierarchy and led to his reintegration into the political mainstream. Under his leadership, the
                    BJP secured a significant victory in the December 2002 legislative assembly elections, winning 127
                    of the 182 seats in the chamber (including a seat for Modi). Projecting a manifesto for growth and
                    development in Gujarat, the BJP was again victorious in the 2007 state assembly elections, with a
                    seat total of 117, and the party prevailed again in the 2012 polls, garnering 115 seats. Both times
                    Modi won his contests and returned as chief minister.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During his time as head of the Gujarat government, Modi established a formidable reputation as an
                    able administrator, and he was given credit for the rapid growth of the state’s economy. In
                    addition, his and the party’s electoral performances helped advance Modi’s position as not only the
                    most-influential leader within the party but also a potential candidate for prime minister of India.
                    In June 2013 Modi was chosen the leader of the BJP’s campaign for the 2014 elections to the Lok
                    Sabha.

                <br>
                <li><strong>Premiership of Narendra Modi:-</strong>After a vigorous campaign—in which Modi portrayed
                    himself as a pragmatic candidate who could turn around India’s underperforming economy—he and the
                    party were victorious, with the BJP winning a clear majority of seats in the chamber. Modi was sworn
                    in as prime minister on May 26, 2014. Soon after he took office, his government embarked on several
                    reforms, including campaigns to improve India’s transportation infrastructure and to liberalize
                    rules on direct foreign investment in the country. Modi scored two significant diplomatic
                    achievements early in his term. In mid-September he hosted a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping,
                    the first time a Chinese leader had been to India in eight years. At the end of that month, having
                    been granted a U.S. visa, Modi made a highly successful visit to New York City, which included a
                    meeting with U.S. Pres. Barack Obama.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As prime minister, Modi oversaw a promotion of Hindu culture and the implementation of economic
                    reforms. The government undertook measures that would broadly appeal to Hindus, such as its attempt
                    to ban the sale of cows for slaughter. The economic reforms were sweeping, introducing structural
                    changes—and temporary disruptions—that could be felt nationwide. Among the most far-reaching was the
                    demonetization and replacement of 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes with only a few hours’ notice. The
                    purpose was to stop “black money”—cash used for illicit activities—by making it difficult to
                    exchange large sums of cash. The following year the government centralized the consumption tax
                    system by introducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which superseded a confusing system of local
                    consumption taxes and eliminated the problem of cascading tax. GDP growth slowed from these changes,
                    though growth had already been high (8.2 percent in 2015), and the reforms succeeded in expanding
                    the government’s tax base. Still, rising costs of living and increasing unemployment disappointed
                    many as grandiose promises of economic growth remained unfulfilled.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This disappointment registered with voters during the elections in five states in late 2018. The BJP
                    lost in all five states, including the BJP strongholds of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and
                    Chhattisgarh. The rival Indian National Congress (Congress Party) won more state assembly seats than
                    the BJP in all five elections. Many observers believed that this portended bad news for Modi and the
                    BJP in the national elections set for the spring of 2019, but others believed that Modi’s charisma
                    would excite the voters. Moreover, a security crisis in Jammu and Kashmir in February 2019, which
                    escalated tensions with Pakistan to the highest point in decades, boosted Modi’s image just months
                    before the election. With the BJP dominating the airwaves during the campaign—in contrast to the
                    lacklustre campaign of Rahul Gandhi and Congress—the BJP was returned to power, and Modi became
                    India’s first prime minister outside of the Congress Party to be reelected after a full term.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In his second term Modi’s government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, stripping it
                    of autonomy in October 2019 and bringing it under the direct control of the union government. The
                    move came under intense criticism and faced challenges in court, not only for the questionable
                    legality of depriving Jammu and Kashmir’s residents of self-determination but also because the
                    government severely restricted communications and movement within the region.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In March 2020, meanwhile, Modi took decisive action to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 in India,
                    swiftly implementing strict nationwide restrictions to mitigate the spread while the country’s
                    biotechnology firms became key players in the race to develop and deliver vaccines worldwide. As
                    part of the effort to counter the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Modi undertook executive
                    action in June to liberalize the agricultural sector, a move that was codified into law in
                    September. Many feared that the reforms would make farmers vulnerable to exploitation, however, and
                    protesters took to the streets in opposition to the new laws. Beginning in November, massive
                    protests were organized and became a regular disruption, particularly in Delhi.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modi’s policies backfired in 2021. Protests escalated (culminating in the storming of the Red Fort
                    in January), and extraordinary restrictions and crackdowns by the government failed to suppress
                    them. Meanwhile, despite the remarkably low spread of COVID-19 in January and February, by late
                    April a rapid surge of cases caused by the new Delta variant had overwhelmed the country’s health
                    care system. Modi, who had held massive political rallies ahead of state elections in March and
                    April, was criticized for neglecting the surge. The BJP ultimately lost the election in a key
                    battleground state despite heavy campaigning. In November, as protests continued and another set of
                    state elections approached, Modi announced that the government would repeal the agricultural
                    reforms.
